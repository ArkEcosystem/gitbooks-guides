![](../.gitbook/assets/importwallet.png)

* _\(Optional\)_ **Require a password to decrypt the Passphrase for an added layer of security**

![](../.gitbook/assets/passwordencryption2.png)

* _\(Optional\)_ **Name the new wallet and copy its address**

![](../.gitbook/assets/importconfirmation.png)

## Wallet Interface <a id="wallet-interface"></a>

The wallet interface page can be reached by clicking on the wallet icon in the navigation bar of the application. On it, you will be able to view your profile or an individual wallet's balance. Some shortcuts are also provided to create or import a wallet and see the details of one of your wallet.

![](../.gitbook/assets/mywallets.png)

### Wallet Details <a id="wallet-details"></a>

On the wallet detail page, which is accessed by clicking on the wallet's name or icon from the wallet interface, you can:

* Transfer ARK.
* View and sort the wallet's transactions.
* Vote for a registered delegate.
* Sign and verify messages cryptographically.
* Purchase ARK through [Changelly](https://changelly.com/).
* Register a second passphrase for added security.
* Register the wallet as a delegate.
* Register a business
* Register a bridgechain

![](../.gitbook/assets/mainwallet.png)

### Sending an ARK Transfer <a id="sending-an-ark-transfer"></a>

Transferring ARK from your wallet is the most common type of transaction.

You can quickly send a transfer by clicking on the _**Send**_ button in the header of the wallet detail page. This will bring up a prompt, on which you can fill in the required information to create a transfer transaction.

![](../.gitbook/assets/transfer.png)

Upon clicking _**Next**_, you will have to review the transfer transaction's details and decide whether to submit it, then discard or save it by clicking _**Send**_, _**Back**_ or _**Save**_.

![](../.gitbook/assets/submittransfer.png)

### Voting for a Registered Delegate <a id="voting-for-a-registered-delegate-and-unvoting"></a>

Delegated Proof of Stake, the consensus algorithm used by the ARK Core, requires network participants to vote for delegates with their funds. A vote is not like a transfer; it merely helps determine which delegates have the most support from network members. You may only vote for one delegate at a time, and your funds are not locked while you are voting.

* **Browse the list of registered delegates**

![](../.gitbook/assets/delegates.png)

* **Choose the delegate you wish to vote for, review their statistics and click** _**Vote**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/delegatestats.png)

* **Fill in the required vote transaction fields and click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/vote.png)

* **Submit, discard or save the vote transaction by pressing either** _**Send**_**,** _**Back**_ **or** _**Save**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/submitvote.png)

### Un-Voting for a Registered Delegate <a id="voting-for-a-registered-delegate-and-unvoting"></a>

* **Open the list of registered delegates**

![](../.gitbook/assets/delegatelistunvote.png)

* **Click on the** _**Unvote**_ **button**

![](../.gitbook/assets/clickunvotebutton.png)

* **Review the delegate's stats and click the** _**Unvote**_ **button**

![](../.gitbook/assets/reviewunvote.png)

* **Choose a transaction fee, enter your security details and click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/unvotedetails.png)

* **Submit the unvote transaction and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either** _**Send**_**,** _**Back**_ **or** _**Save**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/submitunvote.png)

### Signing and Verifying Messages <a id="signing-and-verifying-messages"></a>

The wallet allows you to create and sign a message that other users will be able to verify as authentically yours.

Message signing and verifying is all done under the **Sign** tab of the wallet detail page.

#### Signing a Message <a id="signing-a-message"></a>

With a signed message, others can verify that a given message and signature combination originate from you.

* **Input your security details and the message to sign, then click** _**Sign**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/signmessage.png)

* **Your signed message will appear under the Sign tab of the wallet detail page**

![](../.gitbook/assets/signedmessages.png)

#### Verifying a Message <a id="verifying-a-message"></a>

To verify a message that was signed by a different wallet, you need the wallet's public key, the original message, and the resulting signature.

{% hint style="success" %}
The public key of a wallet is much like the address, except it doesn't follow the same format and is not shown by default in the Desktop Wallet. You can view your wallet's public key by clicking the key icon next to your wallet's address in the wallet detail page's header.
{% endhint %}

The ARK network will only know your public key once you have sent a transaction.

For demonstration purposes, the images below are shown from the perspective of a second wallet, assuming the necessary details to verify the message were provided to the verifying user.

* **Enter the message to verify, the public key of the wallet which was used to sign the message and the resulting signature, then click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/verifymessage.png)

* **See whether the message was successfully verified or not**

![](../.gitbook/assets/verifiedmessage.png)

### Register as a Delegate <a id="register-as-a-delegate"></a>

Registering as a delegate is a simple transaction. It provides network nodes with a record of the sending address opening itself to accept votes from other wallets. You can only vote for an address that was registered in this fashion.

* **Expose more options in the wallet detail page by clicking the icon in the header**

![](../.gitbook/assets/moreicon.png)

* **Click the** _**Register delegate**_ **button**

![](../.gitbook/assets/registerdelegatebutton.png)

* **Enter your desired Username, Transaction fee and security details; then click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/delegateregistration.png)

* **Verify the delegate registration transaction details and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either** _**Send**_**,** _**Back**_ **or** _**Save**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/submitdelegateregistration.png)

###  **Resign as a Delegate**

Delegate Resignation is a new transaction type being offered in ARK Core v2.6 that gives delegates the ability to resign and exclude themselves from the delegate rankings. 

1. **Open the ARK Desktop Wallet and select the vertical ellipsis icon next to the right of the send button.**
2. **Select the dropdown menu under Registration and select “Resign Delegate”**
3. **Enter your wallet’s passphrase \(or password if you are using encrypted option\) and confirm the transaction.**
4. **Refresh your wallet and you will see that after the next round of forging, your delegate will be marked resigned and no longer counted in the Active Delegate Rankings \(Top 51\).**

### Register a Second Passphrase <a id="register-a-second-passphrase"></a>

Security is critical. By issuing a second signature transaction, you tell network nodes to verify that every transaction coming from your wallet is also signed by another Passphrase.

* **Show more options in the wallet detail page by clicking the icon in the header**

![](../.gitbook/assets/moreicon.png)

* **Click the** _**Second passphrase**_ **button**

![](../.gitbook/assets/secondsignaturebutton.png)

* **Save your 12-word BIP39 second Passphrase and click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/secondsignaturegeneration.png)

* **Prove that you have saved your second Passphrase, select your desired transaction fee, enter your security details and click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/secondsignatureverification.png)

* **Verify the second signature transaction details and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either** _**Send**_**,** _**Back**_ **or** _**Save**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/submitsecondsignature.png)

### Register a Business <a id="register-a-second-passphrase"></a>

By registering your business on-chain, all the data regarding your business is stored in a decentralized manner. In addition, businesses can take control of their information and use it as a way to validate the products or services they have created.

1. **Open the ARK Desktop Wallet and select the vertical ellipsis icon next to the right of the send button.**
2. **Select the drop-down menu under Registration and select “Register Business”**
3. **Fill out the form with your business information**
4. **Select your transaction fee and enter your passphrase.**
5. **Select “Next” and after reviewing your information, select “Send”**

###  **Business Update Transaction**

We understand that businesses are not static. Over time a business may evolve, and information will need to be updated. In addition, it is likely that more information will be stored on-chain in the future. Therefore, in terms of being practical, we wanted to make sure that there was an easy way for users to make changes to their information in a quick and efficient manner.

1. **Open the ARK Desktop Wallet and go to the Business Tab and click on the vertical ellipsis.**
2. **Select the drop-down menu under Registration and select “Update Business”**
3. **Use the form to update your business information. \(Things such as your VAT, repository address, and website can be updated thru this transaction\)**
4. **Select your transaction fee and enter your passphrase.**
5. **Select “Next” and after reviewing your information, select “Send”**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*q24M5s795Fzqh2OPHLDkHg.gif)

### Business Resignation Transaction

 In a way similar to our **delegate resignation transaction**, the business resignation transaction allows a user to delist their business and mark it as inactive. 

1. **Open the ARK Desktop Wallet and go to the Business Tab and click on the vertical ellipsis.**
2. **Select the drop-down menu under Registration and select “Business Resignation”**
3. **Verify your business name and information before proceeding.**
4. **Select your transaction fee and enter your passphrase.**
5. **Select “Next” and after reviewing your information, select “Send”**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*D0vR-A12suSB-_hsvjpOeg.gif)

### Bridgechain Registration Transaction

Once you have registered your business on-chain you will also have an option to register your bridgechains. By doing this, we’ll be able to automatically discover your bridgechain’s configuration for our upcoming projects such as Deployer, Marketplace and also have an option to be auto-discoverable within our Wallets.

* **Select the 'Business' tab and then select 'Register Bridgechain'**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*8Jzqa26OfBysINeYx358PA.png)

* **On the initial screen, you can add seed servers from your bridgechain, they can be used to obtain blockchain data from your bridgechain.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gBPqnbxVWCQ0_kMqESpgrg.png)

 ****

*  **On the second screen, you can input the name of your bridgechain, genesis hash \(this one is unique to each bridgechain\), bridgechain repository, asset repository and default API port.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1098/1*OLOvx3GqJG1cFTFUTarFtw.png)

### **Bridgechain Update Transaction**

If you want to update your bridgechain information you can do so by initiating a Bridgechain Update transaction. This can be used to update information such as seed nodes, name of the bridgechain or repositories.

* **To update your business, select the Business tab and then select the bridgechain that you want to update from the list.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YbyWv88F3ppO2Y6iqyXOKw.png)

* **This will open a transaction modal where you can click on the update button, which will open update modal.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bRdqU62xc5f3QILmau5oVg.png)

### **Bridgechain Resignation Transaction**

If you want to resign your bridgechain from the blockchain you have an option for that as well. Resigning all of your bridgechains is a requirement for resigning your business.

* **To resign your bridgechain, select the Business tab and then select the bridgechain that you want to resign from the list below.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YbyWv88F3ppO2Y6iqyXOKw.png)

* **This will open a transaction modal where you can click on the resign button, which will open the resign modal.** 

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bRdqU62xc5f3QILmau5oVg.png)



### **IPFS Hash Storage**

 You can now also save [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) compliant hashes on the ARK’s Public Network. By doing so, you can have an independent method of registering your IPFS data on the ARK Public Network.

* **To register an IPFS hash, click on the IPFS tab and then select Store Hash**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*EFyzKGRmi5ToKwJkzdO69Q.png)

* **This will open a transaction modal where you can store IPFS hash.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3hCntKz44GxqNbHpzNij0g.png)

## Contact Interface

### Adding a Contact <a id="adding-a-contact"></a>

You can access the contact creation menu by first clicking on the contact icon in the wallet's navigation bar which will expose your contact list.

![](../.gitbook/assets/contacts.png)

* **Enter the contact's address and click** _**Next**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/contactdetails.png)

* _\(Optional\)_ **Enter a name for the contact and click \*Done**

![](../.gitbook/assets/contactconfirmation.png)

* **You can now view that contact's activity**

![](../.gitbook/assets/contactactivity.png)

* **And have access to the contact's activity through the contact interface**

![](../.gitbook/assets/contactinterface.png)
