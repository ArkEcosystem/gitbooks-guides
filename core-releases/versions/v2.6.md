# v2.6

ARK `v2.6` is a minor update but not backward compatible with `v2.5.X`. This update introduces implementations of AIP11 and AIP18.

* **Upgrade time**: low - upgrading to `v2.6` only requires minimal configuration changes.
* **Complexity**: **high** - AIP11 and AIP18 were implemented which bring various cryptography changes after a milestone is reached.
* **Risk**: high - `v2.6` is not backward compatible with `v2.5` and as it includes cryptography and P2P changes that will result in communication with nodes below 2.6.0 to fail.

## Migrating from v2.5 to v2.6 <a id="migrating-from-v2-5-to-v2-6"></a>

Upgrading from `v2.5` to `v2.6` is fairly straightforward if you follow the instructions. Even though we try to ensure backward compatibility \(BC\) as much as possible, sometimes it is not possible or very complicated to avoid it and still create a good solution to a problem.
